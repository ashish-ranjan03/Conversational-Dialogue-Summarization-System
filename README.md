# Conversational-Dialogue-Summarization-System
This project implements an end-to-end conversational dialogue summarization system using fine-tuned T5 transformers and HuggingFace ecosystem. Built specifically for messenger-like conversations, the system employs abstractive summarization techniques to generate concise, coherent summaries from conversational dialogues.

The project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing (SAMSum dataset) through T5-small model fine-tuning, evaluation, and production deployment via FastAPI. The implementation showcases transfer learning capabilities, achieving effective summarization of conversational contexts while maintaining semantic accuracy and readability.
