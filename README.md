# Conversational-Dialogue-Summarization-System
This project is a comprehensive deep-dive into building, fine-tuning, and evaluating state-of-the-art text summarization models using the HuggingFace Transformers library. It covers both abstractive and extractive summarization approaches, using modern Transformer architectures such as BART, T5, and PEGASUS.

The goal is to provide a production-grade pipeline for text summarization — from data preprocessing to model fine-tuning, evaluation, and inference — all within a modular, reproducible, and scalable framework.
